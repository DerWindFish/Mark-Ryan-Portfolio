            In the fall of 2021, being tired and burnt out at my job as a 
        supervisor at Starbucks, I sat down with a friend of mine who had just recently taken 
        a coding bootcamp and landed a job and talked about how he did it.
        That converstation set me down the path I am on today.</p>
